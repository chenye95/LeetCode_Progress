"""
On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations:
- Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or;
- Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display.

Initially, the calculator is displaying X. Return the minimum number of operations needed to display Y.
