"""
There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where
connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly
or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
